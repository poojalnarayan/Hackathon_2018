The client side is a java script which is an extenstion to your gmail account, which gets the email body and sends it to the server where the machine learning model is saved. The model on server side is built and ready, at runtime, you just need to predict based on the writing style of the auther if the email is actually written by the intended author. This result is dispalyed at the sidepanel in your gmail inbox itself.
It captures word usage, writing style and such linguistic signature of that particular author, by learning from his older messages!
